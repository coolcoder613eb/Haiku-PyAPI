BKeyStore constructors

.. rubric:: `Constructors`

.. function:: BKeyStore()

   Create a new BKeyStore object that you can use to query, 
   retrieve and store keys in the system's key store.

   This is a cheap object to make, as it has no data associated 
   with it. The recommended use is to create an instance on the 
   stack whenever you want to interact with the API.
